# WANIEBI is a simple website that allows to count things from O to infinity. I mainly built it to test my understanding of JavaScript and the DOM.

I used HTML/CSS and Javascript to build it.

I used JavasCript mainly to let User enter the name of the thing he/she is counting and to increment and save values.
